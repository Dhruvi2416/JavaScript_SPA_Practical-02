          I’ve been called a ‘pragmatic’ designer. I take that as a compliment.
          <br />
          <br />
          My professional work slants towards product design that can make a
          measurable impact. Usability over style. Stylish when called for.
          <br />
          <br />
          Learning from your customers and shipping delightful, yet useful tools
          for them is both rewarding and challenging, which is why I've been
          drawn to working with early products, especially those where you can
          get to know your users personally.
          <br />
          <br />
          I’ve had the privilege of working with some great teams on some truly
          impactful products, and have learned a thing or two along the way. I
          bring that experience to new ventures and try to share it with folks
          through mentoring and writing.
          <br />
          <br />
          I tend to think about design like a founder, because I’ve been one.
          Balancing process and instinct, the goal is to find harmony between
          user delight and business strategy, as fast as you can deliver
          quality.
          <br />
          <br />
          If this seems like your cup of tea, I'd be pleased to chat about your
          project needs. My availability is below.
